# Elm Style Guide

These are the guidelines we follow when writing [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) code at [NoRedInk](https://www.noredink.com/jobs).

Note to NoRedInkers: These conventions have evolved over time, so there will always be some parts of the code base that don't follow everything. This is how we want to write new code, but there's no urgency around changing old code to conform. Feel free to clean up old code if you like, but don't feel obliged.

## How to Namespace Modules

### `Nri.`
`Nri.Button`, `Nri.Emoji`, `Nri.Leaderboard`

A reusable part of the site's look and feel, which could go in the visual style guide. While some parts could be made open source, these are tied directly to NRI stuff.

When adding a new abstraction to Nri, announce it on slack and seek as much feedback as possible! this will be used in multiple places.

Further breakdown of the module is subject to [How to Structure Modules for Reuse](#how-to-structure-modules-for-reuse).

#### Examples
- Common navigation header with configurable buttons

#### Non-examples
- `elm-css` colors and fonts should go in [here](https://github.com/NoRedInk/nri-elm-css)


### `Data.`
`Data.Assignment`, `Data.Course`, `Data.User`

Data (and functions related to that data) shared across multiple pages.

#### Examples
- Data types for a concept shared between multiple views (e.g `Data.StudentTask`)
- A type that represents a "base" type record definition. A simple example might be a `Student`, which you will then extend in `Page` (see below)
- Helpers for those data types

### `Page.`
`Page.Writing.Rate.Main`, `Page.Writing.Rate.Update`, `Page.Writing.Rate.Model.Decoder`

A page on the site, which has its own URL. These are not reusable, and implemented using a combination of types from `Data` and modules from `Nri`. Comments for usage instructions aren't required, as code isn't intended to be reusable.

The module name should follow the URL. Naming after the URL is subject to [How to Structure Modules for A Page](#how-to-structure-modules-for-a-page). The purpose of this convention is so when you have a URL, you can easily figure out where to find the module.

If a module ends with `Main`, everything between `Page` and `Main` **MUST** correspond to a URL.

#### Examples
- `Page.Admin.RelevantTerms.Main` corresponds to the URL `/admin/relevant_terms`.
- `Page.Learn.ChooseSourceMaterials.Main` corresponds to the URL `/learn/choose_source_materials`.
- `Page.Preferences.Main` corresponds to the URL `/preferences`.
- `Page.Teacher.Courses.Assignments.Main` corresponds to the URL `/teach/courses/:id/assignments`.
    N.B. The `/:id` is dropped from the module name to avoid too much complexity.

#### Non-examples
- `Page.Mastery.Main` corresponds to no URL. We would expect `/mastery` to exist, but it doesn't. Finding the module from the URL will be hard.
- `Page.Teach.WritingCycles.Rate.Main` corresponds to no URL. We would expect `/teach/writing_cycles/rate` or `/teach/writing_cycles/:id/rate` to exist, but neither do. Finding the module from the URL will be hard.

### Top-level modules
`Accordion`, `Dropdown`

Something reusable that we might open source, that aren't tied directly to any NRI stuff. Name it what we'd name it if we'd already open-sourced it.

Make as much of this opensource-ready as possible:

- Must have simple documentation explaining how to use the module. No need to go overboard, but it needs to be there. Imagine you're publishing the package on elm-package! Use `--warn` to get errors for missing documentation.
- Expose Model and the Msg constructors.
- Use `type alias Model a = { a | b : c }` to allow extending of things.
- Provide an API file as example usage of the module.
- Follow either the [elm-api-component](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-api-components) pattern, or the [elm-html-widgets](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-html-widgets) pattern

#### Examples
- Filter component
- Long polling component
- Tabs component


## How to Structure Modules for Reuse

When the module is small enough, it's fine to let a single file hold all relevant code:

- Nri/
  - Button.elm

When the module gets more complex, break out each of the Elm architecture triad into its own file while keeping the top-level Elm file as the public interface to import:

- `Nri/`
  - `Leaderboard.elm` -- Expose Model, init, view, update, and other types/functions necessary for use
  - `Leaderboard/`  (only exists if necessary)
      - Introduce private submodules as necessary

We don't have a metric to determine exactly when to move from a single-file module to a multi-file module: trust your gut feelings and aesthetics.

### Anti-pattern

Don't do: `Nri/Leaderboard/Main.elm` - the filename `Main.elm` is reserved for entrypoints under the `Page` namespace, so that we can run an automatic check during CI, which enforces the [stricter naming convention for modules under `Page`](./#examples-2).


## How to Structure Modules for A Page

Our Elm apps generally take this form:

- Main.elm
    - `type alias Flags = { ...a record that directly corresponds to the JSON page data... }`
    - `decoder : Json.Decode.Decoder Flags`
    - `type alias Model = { ...a record with fields... }`
    - `init : Flags -> (Model, Cmd Msg)`
    - `type Msg = ... variants for each possible message ...`
    - `update : Msg -> Model -> (Model, Cmd Msg)`
    - `view : Model -> Html Msg`

Inside **`Model`**, we contain the actual model for the view state of our program. Note that we generally don't include non-view state inside here, preferring to instead generalize things away from the view where possible. For example, we might have a record with a list of assignments in our `Model` file, but the assignment type itself would be in a module called `Data.Assignment`.

**`Msg`, `update`** contains our update code. Inside here most of our business logic lives.

Inside **`view`**, we define the view for our model and set up any event handlers we need.

**`Flags`, `decoder : Decoder Flags`** is a decoder for the flags of the app. We aim to keep our decoders basic and so decode into a special `Flags` type that mirrors the structure of the raw JSON instead of the structure of the `Model` type. The `Flags` and `Model` modules should not depend on each other.

**`Main.elm`** is our entry file. Here, we import everything from the other files and actually connect everything together.

It calls `Html.programWithFlags` with:
- `init`, runs `decoder` and turns the resulting `Flags` type into a `Model`.
- `update`
- `view`
- `subscriptions`, defined top-level if there are any subscriptions, or simply an inline `\model -> Sub.none` if the page has no subscriptions.

Additionally we setup ports for interop with JS in this file. We run elm-make on this file to generate a JS file that we can include elsewhere.

To summarize:

- `Main.elm`
    - Our entry point. Decodes the flags, creates the initial model, calls `Html.programWithFlags` and sets up ports.
    - Compile target for `elm-make`
    - Imports the reusable module.

- `<ModuleName>`.elm
    - Contains the `Model` type for the view alone.
    - Contains the `Msg` type for the view, and the `update` function.
    - Contains the `view` code
    - Contains the `decoder : Decoder Flags` and `Flags` type if necessary

## Ports

### All ports should bring things in as `Json.Value`

The single source of runtime errors that we have right now are through ports receiving values they shouldn't. If a `port something : Signal Int` receives a float, it will cause a runtime error. We can prevent this by just wrapping the incoming things as `Json.Value`, and handle the errorful data through a `Decoder` result instead.

### Ports should always have documentation

I don't want to have to go out from our Elm files to find where a port is being used most of the time. Simply adding a line or two explaining what the port triggers, or where the values coming in from a port can help a lot.


## Model

### Model shouldn't have _any_ view state within them if they aren't tied to views

For example, an assignment should not have a `openPopout` attribute. Doing so means we can't use that type again in another situation.


## Naming

### Use descriptive names instead of tacking on underscores

Instead of this:

```elm
-- Don't do this --
markDirty model =
  let
    model_ =
      { model | dirty = True }
  in
    model_
```

...just come up with a name.

```elm
-- Instead do this --
markDirty model =
  let
    dirtyModel =
      { model | dirty = True }
  in
    dirtyModel
```

## Function Composition

### Use anonymous function [`\_ ->`](http://elm-lang.org/docs/syntax#functions) over [`always`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Basics#always)

It's more concise, more recognizable as a function, and makes it easier to change your mind later and name the argument.

```elm
-- Don't do this --
on "click" Json.value (always (Signal.message address ()))
```

```elm
-- Instead do this --
on "click" Json.value (\_ -> Signal.message address ())
```

### Only use backward function application [`<|`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Basics#<|) when parens would be awkward

Instead of this:

```elm
-- Don't do this --
foo <| bar <| baz qux
```

...prefer using parentheses, because they'd look fine:

```elm
-- Instead do this --
foo (bar (baz qux))
```

However this would be awkward:

```elm
-- Don't do this --
customDecoder string
  (\str ->
    case str of
      "one" ->
        Result.Ok 1

      "two" ->
        Result.Ok 2

      "three" ->
        Result.Ok 3
    )
```

...so prefer this instead:

```elm
-- Instead do this --
customDecoder string
  <| \str ->
      case str of
        "one" ->
          Result.Ok 1

        "two" ->
          Result.Ok 2

        "three" ->
          Result.Ok 3
```

### Always use [`Json.Decode.Pipeline`](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline) instead of [`mapN`](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/core/latest/Json-Decode#map2)

Even though this would work...

```elm
-- Don't do this --
algoliaResult : Decoder AlgoliaResult
algoliaResult =
  map6 AlgoliaResult
    (field "id" int)
    (field "name" string)
    (field "address" string)
    (field "city" string)
    (field "state" string)
    (field "zip" string)
```

...it's inconsistent with the longer decoders, and must be refactored if we want to add more fields.

Instead do this from the start:

```elm
-- Instead do this --
import Json.Decode.Pipeline exposing (required, decode)

algoliaResult : Decoder AlgoliaResult
algoliaResult =
  decode AlgoliaResult
    |> required "id" int
    |> required "name" string
    |> required "address" string
    |> required "city" string
    |> required "state" string
    |> required "zip" string
```

This will also make it easier to add [optional fields](http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/NoRedInk/elm-decode-pipeline/latest/Json-Decode-Pipeline#optional) where necessary.

[json2elm](http://json2elm.org/) can generate pipeline-style decoders from
raw JSON.

## Syntax

### Use `case..of` over `if` where possible

`case..of` is clever as it will generate more efficent JS, and it also allows you to catch unmatched patterns at compile time. It's also cheap to extend this data with something more useful later on, like if you need to add another branch. This saves code diffs.

## Identifiers

### Prefer the use of union types over simple types for identifiers

Using a type alias for a unique identifier allows for easy mistakes supplying any old string or integer that happens to be in scope, rather than an actual identifier. Prefer using a single case union instead:

```elm
-- Don't do this --
type alias Student =
    { id : StudentId
    , name : String
    , age : Int
    }


type alias StudentId =
    String

getStudentDetails : StudentId -> Student
getStudentDetails sid =
    -- Passing a name in here by mistake will compile fine --
    ...
```

```elm
-- Do this instead --

-- In one module file --
module Thing.StudentId exposing (StudentId)

type StudentId
    = StudentId String
    
-- All conversions go in this module --

-- In the other module file --
module Thing.Student exposing (Student)

import Thing.StudentId exposing (StudentId)

type alias Student =
    { id : StudentId
    , name : String
    , age : Int
    }

getStudentDetails : StudentId -> Student
getStudentDetails sid =
    -- The compiler will reject strings --
    ...
```

The ID module should expose an intentionally minimal set of conversion functions:

* We should never expose conversion functions before they're needed. Start with module CustomerId exposing (CustomerId) and expand the API from there only as necessary!
* We should avoid exposing conversion functions whose types depend on the internals of the custom type. (For example, decoder : Decoder CustomerId is great, but functions like fromInt : Int -> CustomerId make the system brittle to implementation details. Exposing an Int -> CustomerId function should be avoided unless there is a very important production reason to introduce it. If tests need an Int -> CustomerId function, they can easily write one using CustomerId.decoder and Debug.crash, since in tests Debug.crash is as harmless as any other test failure.)


To use these types as keys in collections, use  [elm-sorter-experiment](https://github.com/rtfeldman/elm-sorter-experiment/). You will need to create a sorter for your identifier - the ordering may or may not be relevant for your use case.

```elm
-- In the ID module --
module Thing.StudentId exposing (StudentId, studentIdSorter)

import Sort exposing (Sorter)
-- Rest of your code... --

studentIdSorter : Sorter StudentId
studentIdSorter =
    Sort.by (\(StudentId sid) -> sid) Sort.alphabetical

-- In use: --
module Thing.DoLogic

import Thing.StudentId exposing (StudentId, studentIdSorter)
import Sort.Dict


type alias Model =
    { students : Sort.Dict.Dict StudentId Student }

init : List Student -> Model
init students =
    students
        |> List.map (\s -> ( s.id, s ))
        |> Sort.Dict.fromList studentIdSorter
```

Notice that because `Sort.Dict.Dict` is an opaque type, your `Model` (and anything which depends upon it) does not depend on `studentIdSorter`. Apart from `Sort.Dict.Dict`, there is also a `Sort.Dict.Set` type.

Code safety in situations where there are multiple types of identifiers (think of a join in SQL terms) increases dramatically with the application of this technique.

## Code Smells

### If a module has a looong list of imports, consider refactoring

Having complicated imports hurts our compile time! I don't know what to say about this other than if you feel that there's something wrong with the top 40 lines of your module because of imports, then it might be time to move things out into another module. Trust your gut.

### If a function can be pulled outside of a let binding, then do it

Giant let bindings hurt readability and performance. The less nested a function, the less functions are used in generated code.

The update function is especially prone to get longer and longer: keep it as small as possible. Smaller functions that don't live in a let binding are more reusable.

### If your application has too many constructors for your Msg type, consider refactoring

Large `case..of` statements hurts compile time. It might be possible that some of your constructors can be combined, for example `type Msg = Open | Close` could actually be `type Msg = SetOpenState Bool`


## Tooling

### Use [`elm-init-scripts`](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-init-scripts) to start your projects

This will generate all the files mentioned [above](#how-to-structure-modules-for-a-page) for you.

### Use [`elm-ops-tooling`](https://github.com/NoRedInk/elm-ops-tooling) to manage your projects

In particular, use `elm_deps_sync` to keep your main elm-package.json in sync with your test elm-package.json.

### Use [`elm-format`](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) on all files

We run the latest version of [`elm-format`](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format) to get uniform syntax formatting on our source code.

This has [several benefits](https://github.com/avh4/elm-format#elm-format),
not the least of which is that it renders many potential style discussions moot,
making it easier to spend more time building things!
